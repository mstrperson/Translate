# Translate

Use the translate() method to calculate the value needed to move a point from /start/ to /end/ under a given scale factor.

## Use
```x = translate(0.6, 100, 350)``` will return a the required value to translate x from 100 to 350 under a 60% scale factor.
the fact that it is ```x``` does not matter.  only the start and end points matter because the ```scale()``` function is symetrical.
